My name is Zhou Fang (方舟) and I am a Data Analysis Engineer at Micron Fab 2 where I work on improving our semiconductor wafer fabrication yield through extracting insights from data wherever I can find them at. My first name is pronounced exactly the same as JOE hence I go by Joe as well. I enjoy using R for the many packages and the R community, and I dab with Python too for its Machine Learning libraries. I'm good at soccer, and supported Chelsea FC since when I was 10 (London is Blue!).

I studied Mechanical Engineering with concentration on Automotive in Turin, Italy where I had a wonderful time. I moved to the United States in 2011 and finished my MS in Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University in the city of New York, I had a great time there, too.

I live in Lehi, UT, with my wife, and my golden retriever - Ollie.
